- âœ… Overall completion percentage
- âœ… Clear progress functionality

### Phase 5: Documentation
- âœ… Created comprehensive README.md
- âœ… Documented curriculum structure in notebook_outline.md
- âœ… Created builder_prompt.md for AI tutor grounding
- âœ… Set up .env.local.example for environment variables
- âœ… This runlog.md for development tracking

### Phase 6: DevOps
- âœ… GitHub Actions workflow for CI/CD:
  - Automated linting
  - Type checking
  - Build verification
  - Runs on push and PR to main branch

## Technical Decisions

### Why Next.js App Router?
- Server and client components for optimal performance
- Built-in API routes for backend functionality
- Excellent TypeScript support
- Great developer experience

### Why localStorage for Progress?
- No backend setup required
- Instant persistence
- Works offline
- Privacy-friendly (data stays on user's device)
- Future: Can migrate to database with authentication

### Why Google Gemini?
- Excellent reasoning capabilities
- Good at educational content
- Generous free tier
- Easy API integration
- Future: Can support multiple AI providers

### Why shadcn/ui approach?
- Full control over components
- No runtime dependencies
- Easy customization
- Copy-paste components into codebase
- Tailwind-based for consistency

## Known Limitations & Future Improvements

### Current Limitations
- Progress data is device-specific (localStorage)
- No user authentication
- AI tutor responses not persistent across sessions
- No offline functionality for AI tutor
- Manual course data updates required

### Planned Improvements
1. **User Authentication**
   - Add authentication (NextAuth.js)
   - Cloud-based progress sync
   - User profiles and settings

2. **Enhanced AI Tutor**
   - Conversation history persistence
   - Code execution sandbox
   - Multi-modal support (images, diagrams)
   - Personalized learning recommendations

3. **Community Features**
   - Discussion forums
   - Study groups
   - Peer code review
   - Mentor matching

4. **Assessment & Certification**
   - Interactive quizzes
   - Coding challenges
   - Project submissions
   - Completion certificates

5. **Platform Integration**
   - OAuth with course platforms
   - Progress sync from external platforms
   - Automatic course updates
   - Course completion verification

6. **Mobile Experience**
   - Progressive Web App (PWA)
   - Native mobile apps
   - Offline course content
   - Push notifications

## Performance Optimizations

- âœ… Static course data (no runtime fetching)
- âœ… Client-side filtering and search
- âœ… Component code splitting
- âœ… Optimized images and assets
- ðŸ”„ Implement caching for Gemini responses
- ðŸ”„ Add service worker for offline support

## Deployment

### Recommended Platforms
- **Vercel**: Optimal for Next.js (zero-config)
- **Netlify**: Good alternative with easy setup
- **AWS Amplify**: For AWS ecosystem integration
- **Self-hosted**: Docker container for full control

### Environment Variables Required
- `GEMINI_API_KEY`: Google Gemini API key

## Version History

### v0.1.0 - Initial Release (2025-10-22)
- Core features implemented
- 20 courses in catalog
- 12 and 24-week learning tracks
- AI tutor integration
- Progress tracking
- Responsive UI
